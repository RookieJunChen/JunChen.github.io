Abstract
===
FullSubNet+ has achieved outstanding performance on Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) Challenge - Interspeech 2021 dataset. However, it does not explicitly model the cross-band dependencies which are important parts of the global spectral information. To this end, this paper firstly introduces the subband communication by a interactive subband model to learn cross-band dependencies and proposes an improved single-channel speech enhancement framework called FullSubNet++. Experimental results on DNS Challenge - Interspeech 2021 dataset show that the proposed FullSubNet++ outperforms FullSubNet+ and other state-of-the-art speech enhancement approaches, and demonstrate the effectiveness of subband communication.
