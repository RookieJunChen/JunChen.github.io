I am currently a Master student at Shenzhen International Graduate School of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Zhiyong Wu](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/zywu/main.htm). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from faculty of computing at [Harbin Institute of Technology](https://www.hit.edu.cn/) in 2021.

My research interests include Expressive Speech Synthesis, Speech Enhancement and Speaker Extraction.

# Experience


1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)


1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 


1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.


1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")


1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  


1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
